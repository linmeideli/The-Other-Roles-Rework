2. Find the folder of your game. You can right click on the game in your library, a menu will appear, click on properties, local data, browse
3. Go back one folder to common and make a copy of your Among Us game folder and paste it somewhere on the same drive.
4. Now unzip and drag or extract the files from the .zip into your Among Us game folder that you just copied, at the `.exe` level (just into the folder).
5. Run the game by starting the .exe from this folder (the first launch might take a while).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

## Windows Installation Epic
1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest)

3. Now unzip and drag or extract the files from the .zip into the original Epic Among Us game folder.
4. Run the game by starting the game in your Epic Games launcher (the first launch might take a while).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

![Install](https://i.imgur.com/pvBAyZN.png)

## Linux Installation
1. Install Among Us via Steam
2. Download newest [release](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest) and extract it to ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among Us
3. Enable winhttp.dll via the proton winecfg (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html)
4. Launch the game via Steam

## The Other Roles Custom Servers
**A custom server is not necessary and official servers are working just fine with the mod, but in case you want to set up and host your own server, here's a guide for you to follow.**

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the Impostor release (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official Impostor-Documentation (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the config.json file:
```    ...
     'AntiCheat': {
       'Enabled': false,
      'BanIpFromGame': false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine.
5. Run the server and setup the client.
Setting up Server as Docker Container:
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

(Currently only the 'nightly' tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)
In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false

Example to docker run command:
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

Or use to run it in the background
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

**If you have any problems regarding custom servers, please contact https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor or https://discord.gg/ThJUGAsz**

# Settings
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):
- **Any Player Can Stop The Start:** If turned off, only the host can stop the game start. If on, all players can do it. Non-hosts stopping the start will send a chat message indicating who stopped it.
- **Number of Crewmates:** The number of Crewmate roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Fill Crewmate Roles (Ignores Min/Max):** Everyone will get a role, even if the settings say there would be plain Crewmates (needs enough roles over 0%).
- **Number of Neutrals:** The number of Neutral roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Modifiers:** The number of Modifiers can be set inside a lobby.
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby.
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (Every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left. Impostor and Jackal meetings also count).
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, they'll vote themself.
- **Hide Player Names:** Hides the names of all players that have role which is unknown to you. Team Lovers/Impostors/Jackal still see the names of their teammates. Impostors can also see the name of the Spy and everyone can still see the age of the mini.
- **Allow Parallel MedBay Scans:** Allows players to perform their MedBay scans at the same time.
- **Shield Last Game First Kill** The first killed player of the previous round will be shielded for all players visible until the first meeting.
- **Finish Tasks Before Haunting Or Zooming Out** The zoom out function as well as haunting will be hidden for the player until all their tasks are finished
- **Admin Table Shows Dead Bodies**
- **Cams Switch To Night Vision If Lights Are Off**  No colors and cosmetics can be seen on the cameras when the lights are off. Mini can be spotted!
- **Impostor Vision Ignores Night Vision Cams**
- **Play On A Random Map** If enabled it allows you to set percentages for each current map, except ehT dlekS. 
- **Ghosts Can See Roles.**
- **Ghosts Can See Votes.**
- **Ghosts Can Additionally See Modifier.**
- **Ghosts See Tasks And Other Info** Other Info: Things like who is cursed, cuffed etc. but also the medic shield, flashes, engineer fix etc.
- **The map is accessable during a meeting and will show your last location when a body gets reported/meeting gets called.**
- **When you're a ghost and done with tasks, you'll get a zoom out/overview function.**
- **Task Counts:** You are now able to select more tasks.
- **Role Summary:** When a game ends there will be a list of all players, their roles, their task progression and how many player a killer killed.
- **Darker/Lighter:** Displays color type of each player in meetings.
- **Show The Settings In-Game** You can use the button located under the map button or the F1-key to open or close the display of the lobby settings

### Task Count Limits per map
You can configure:
- Up to 4 common tasks
- Up to 23 short tasks
- Up to 15 long tasks

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.
-----------------------

### Random Maps
**Play On A Random Map** If enabled it allows you to set percentages for each current map.

**Finish Tasks Before Haunting Or Zooming Out** You have to finish your tasks before you get the possibility to zoom out.

**Use Random Map Setting Presets:** When this option is turned on, the game will switch to the `Random Preset <MapName>` when a game is started on a random map. **This includes vanilla options!**. This makes it possible to e.g. play with less tasks on large maps like Airship.
The game will **remain** in the preset for that random map after the match.

The random map presets can still be used like normal presets, if you **turn of** `Play On A Random Map` (make sure you do this in all presets you are using).



# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# Colors
Note: Lighter and Darker colors are no longer based on the players color. Instead they are assigned alternatingly, s.t. they are always balanced in a lobby.

A big thank you goes to Avlona & Listoric for sorting the colors in the best possible order (which is surprisingly hard to do)!
![TOR Colors](./Images/TOR_colors.jpg)

# Roles

## Role Assignment

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Mafia, Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 Impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options

## Morphling
### **Team: Impostors**
The Morphling is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player.\
After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for a set duration which can be changed in the options.\
\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the Mini when they copy its look.
- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator).
- Tracker arrows keep working.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Morphling Spawn Chance | -
| Morphling Cooldown | -
| Morph Duration | Time the Morphling stays morphed
-----------------------

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an Impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode.\
The camouflage mode lasts for x-seconds (configurable) and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats\
are hidden and all players have the same color.\
\
**NOTE:**

- The color of the footprints turns gray (also the ones that were already on the ground).

- Tracker arrows keep working

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Camouflager Spawn Chance | -

-----------------------

## Vampire
### **Team: Impostors**
The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, they die at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).
- If there is a Vampire in the game, there can't be a Warlock.
- If the Vampire bites a player and the Thief kills the Vampire, the bite will still be performed, but the new Vampire will be displayed in the kill animation.
- If the Vampire bites a player and gets killed before the bite is performed, the biten player will survive.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Vampire Spawn Chance | -
| Vampire Kill Delay | -
| Vampire Cooldown | Sets the kill/bite cooldown
| Vampire Can Kill Near Garlics | The Vampire can never bite when their victim is near a garlic. If this option is set to true, they can still perform a normal kill there.
-----------------------

## Eraser
### **Team: Impostors**
The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or their target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors.\
Depending on the options they can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of their target, depending on whom the Eraser erased).
- As the erase is being triggered before the ejection of a player, a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.
- Modifier will not be erased.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Eraser Spawn Chance | -
| Eraser Cooldown | The Eraser's cooldown will increase by 10 seconds after every erase.
| Eraser Can Erase Anyone | If set to false, they can't erase the Spy and other Impostors
-----------------------

## Trickster
### **Team: Impostors**
The Trickster is an Impostor that can place 3 jack-in-the-boxes that are invisible at first to other players.\
If the Trickster has placed all of their boxes they will be converted into a vent network after the next Meeting, usable only by the Trickster themself, but the boxes are also revealed to the others.\
If the boxes are converted to a vent network, the Trickster gains a new ability "Lights out" to limit the visibility of Non-Impostors, that cannot be fixed by other players. Lights are automatically restored after a while.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Impostors will get a text indicator at the bottom of the screen to notify them if the lights are out due to the Trickster ability, as there is no sabotage arrows or task to sabotage text to otherwise notify them about it.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Trickster Spawn Chance | -
| Trickster Box Cooldown | Cooldown for placing jack-in-the-boxes
| Trickster Lights Out Cooldown | Cooldown for their "lights out" ability
| Trickster Lights Out Duration | Duration after which the light is automatically restored
-----------------------

## Cleaner
### **Team: Impostors**
The Cleaner is an Impostor who has the ability to clean up dead bodies.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Kill and Clean cooldown are shared, preventing them from immediately cleaning their own kills.
- If there is a Cleaner in the game, there can't be a Vulture.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Cleaner Spawn Chance | -
| Cleaner Cooldown | Cooldown for cleaning dead bodies
-----------------------

## Warlock
### **Team: Impostors**
The Warlock is an Impostor, that can curse another player (the cursed player doesn't get notified).\
If the cursed person stands next to another player, the Warlock is able to kill that player (no matter how far away they are).\
Performing a kill with the help of a cursed player, will lift the curse and it will result in the Warlock being unable to move for a configurable amount of time.\
The Warlock can still perform normal kills, but the two buttons share the same cooldown.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Warlock can always kill their Impostor mates (and even themself) using the "cursed kill"
- If there is a Warlock in the game, there can't be a Vampire
- Performing a normal kill, doesn't lift the curse

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Warlock Spawn Chance | -
| Warlock Cooldown | Cooldown for using the Curse and curse Kill
| Warlock Root Time | Time the Warlock is rooted in place after killing using the curse

## Bounty Hunter
### **Team: Impostors**
The Bounty Hunter is an Impostor, that continuously get bounties (the targeted player doesn't get notified).\
The target of the Bounty Hunter swaps after every meeting and after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Bounty Hunter kills their target, their kill cooldown will be a lot less than usual.\
Killing a player that's not their current target results in an increased kill cooldown.\
Depending on the options, there'll be an arrow pointing towards the current target.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The target won't be an Impostor, a Spy or the Bounty Hunter's Lover.
- Killing the target resets the timer and a new target will be selected.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Bounty Hunter Spawn Chance | -
| Duration After Which Bounty Changes | -

If the Witch dies before the meeting starts or if the Witch is being guessed during the meeting, the spellbound players will be highlighted but they'll survive in any case.\
Depending on the options you can choose whether voting the Witch out will save all the spellbound players or not.\

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be their Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds them to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal and remain as they were.\
Also if a Spy or Impostor gets sidekicked, they still will appear red to the Impostors.

The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Jester wins by vote (even as Mini)
2. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. Lovers among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostors left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and their Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Mini, while it's growing up. After that they can kill it or select it as its Sidekick.
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew.)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game, the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.

## Lovers

There are always two Lovers which are linked together.\
Their primary goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game.\
If one Lover dies (and the option is activated), the other Lover suicides.\
You can specify the chance of one Lover being an Impostor.\
The Lovers never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is.\
The Lovers win, if they are both alive when the game ends. They can also win with their original team (e.g. a dead Impostor Lover can win with the Impostors, an Arsonist Lover can still achieve an Arsonist win).\
If one of the Lovers is a killer (i.e. Jackal/Sidekick/Impostor), they can achieve a "Lovers solo win" where only the Lovers win.\
If there is no killer among the Lovers (e.g. an Arsonist Lover + Crewmate Lover) and they are both alive when the game ends, they win together with the Crewmates.\
If there's an Impostor/Jackal + Crewmate Lover in the game, the tasks of a Crewmate Lover won't be counted (for a task win) as long as they're alive.\
If the Lover dies, their tasks will also be counted.\
You can enable an exclusive chat only for Lovers.

**NOTE:**
In a 2 Crewmates vs 2 Impostors (or 2 members of team Jackal) and the Lovers are not in the same team, the game is not automatically over since the Lovers can still achieve a solo win. E.g. if there are the following roles Impostor + ImpLover + Lover + Crewmate left, the game will not end and the next kill will decide if the Impostors or Lovers win.

## Mini

The Mini's character is smaller and hence visible to everyone in the game.\
The Mini cannot be killed until it turns 18 years old, however it can be voted out.

**Impostor/Jackal Mini:**
- While growing up the kill cooldown is doubled. When it's fully grown up its kill cooldown is 2/3 of the default one.
- If it gets thrown out of the ship, everything is fine.

**Crewmate Mini:**

**Neutral Mini:**
- The cooldown is not effected, except for the Team Jackal/Sidekick.
- If it gets thrown out of the ship, everything is fine except for the Jester.
- If the Jester Mini gets voted out the game will end in a Jester win.

The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\
Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter gets the role of their target, depending on whom the Eraser erased)
- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or Engineer sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the Shifter
can only use them, if the previous player did not use them before)
- The Shifter button is located in the bottom left corner right next to the garlic button (if the Vampire is enabled)

When a Prop dies, they will either join the Hunter team or die (setting).
